# Import and Hierarchy

## Importing

Create a new folder under `Prefabs/Reefscape/Robots/Mods` for your mod and name it what you wish to name your pack

:::note

This is the overall PACK, not the robot itself

:::

Create a new `ReefscapeModpackMetadata` under `Games/Reefscape` and fill out the fields (picture is incorrect)

![Create Metadata](@site/static/img/lynk/createmetadata.png)

![Modpack Info](@site/static/img/lynk/modpackinfo.png)

Copy the existing 2910 folder under `Prefabs/Reefscape/Robots` to your new folder; we will use this as an example to follow along.

To make the next step not painful, I recommend clicking the lock in the top right of the inspector menu.

![Lock](@site/static/img/lynk/lockopen.png)

This locks the inspector object allowing you to click freely

Now open the 2910 folder you copied and drag the `JackInTheBot` Scriptable object into the robots list
Disable the lock.

Then rename the 2910 things to 9496 and Lynk, after doing so, re-fill out the 9496 SO (scriptable Object) as the fields are outdated.

Now go to the `Imports/Reefscape/Models/Robots` folder add a 9496 folder and import `9496(2025).fbx`

With that done we can go to the 9496 prefab we made in our folder, and delete everything but the drivetrain.

![Empty Prefab](@site/static/img/lynk/emptyprefab.png)

Now drag the 9496 model from the import into the hierarchy and we are ready to start

## Hierarchy Setup

Our scene now looks like this.

![Robot Imported](@site/static/img/lynk/sidewaysprefab.png)

Lets use the rotate tool while holding control to rotate the robot 90 degrees such that Y is up, Z is forward, and X is sideways.

From there we check the model height vs the wheel height and see if the model is low.

:::note

Moving the 3d Icons slider to the left will shrink the icon in the middle

After moving the model until the heights match we can start the next step.

Right click the model in the hierarchy, search unpack, and click it.

Right click the top (9496) object and create an empty. Name it `Stationary`.

Move the following from the model to this new object. 

![Move Parts to Stationary](@site/static/img/lynk/stationary.png)

Now go to `Stationary` and click the little eye to hide things. This will help speed the process along.
 
Unfortunately you may notice their climber is a part of the chassis model. We will come back to that later.

Hide the funnel, then create a new empty child of 9496. Name it `Elevator`, and reposition it to be directly under the elevator.

![Elevator Empty](@site/static/img/lynk/superstructure.png)

:::warning

It is **very** important you don't change the Y height of anything in the next steps.

:::

Lynk is a 2 stage elevator, so we want to make 3 children of `Elevator`: `Stationary`, `Stage1`, and `Stage2`. Again, do NOT move these.

Move the end effector model into `Stage2` and hide it. Now we want to select the carriage model using ctrl and left click.

Every time you move a set of models into `Stage2`, un-hide and hide it again to see what's left. This is also a great time to optimize by removing hardware.

Another trick to help is that if you ctrl select `Stage2` then drag it on itself, it will auto child all selected objects to it without the annoying scroll speed of direct dragging.

Unless unity is consistently crashing I also recommend disabling auto save as it saves a significant amount of time.

Once that is done you should have something like this:

![Separated Elevator](@site/static/img/lynk/elevatorprefab.png)

Shift select all children of `Stage2` and right click to create an empty parent. Name it `Model`.

![Stage 2 Empty Child](@site/static/img/lynk/stage2model.png)

Repeat the same for `Stage1`.

Fortunately for our sanity's sake, the final part will be easy. Since only the stationary parts are left, we can simply drag select the whole model in the scene view and then adjust it in the inspector.

You may run into issues selecting `Drivetrain` and the base prefab. Simply unselect those, this model is quite large so selecting those isn't uncommon.

The elevator hierarchy now looks like this. 

![Elevator Hierarchy](@site/static/img/lynk/elevhierarchy.png)

And after hiding `Stationary` we should see nothing.

You can also delete the Thin 2 Stage Example as the children are holding nothing useful anymore.

Unhide the funnel, add a new game object named `Funnel`, and under it do the following

Create an empty named `FunnelPivot`, and align it with the drop pivot.

![Funnel Pivot](@site/static/img/lynk/ramppivot.png)

Add another for the roller named `RollerPivot`.
Move the hex and wheels into `RollerPivot`.
Do the same for the moving parts of the funnel into `FunnelPivot`.

![Move Funnel into FunnelPivot](@site/static/img/lynk/rampprefab.png)

Create a `Stationary` object in `Funnel` and move the remaining objects there.

![Unity Prefs](@site/static/img/lynk/funnelpivotmodel.png)

With the funnel done we can delete the `9496(2025)` object as it no longer has any models on it.
Re-child the algae arm models to `AlgaeArm`.

Returning to the elevator, unhide `Stage2`, then add a new object child of `Stage2` named `AlgaeArm` and reposition it for the algae arm

Next up, re-enable the drivetrain and add a climber object. Align it as the pivot to make the next steps easier.

![Climber Cross Section](@site/static/img/lynk/drivetraincutout.png)

Create an empty child named `ClimbBar`, and `ClimbWedge`.

Congratulations, you have finished the first tedious part…. Now to paint the whole thing.
Inside the Materials folder you will find the available colors.
